# Cart-with-Sequelize-Express-and-jQuery

A simple shopping list application, where you can add Product Name, Manufacturer Name and Price of product and that will be stored into Database.

Created API with Express which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
Read more about it [here](https://expressjs.com/)

Used Sequelize library, Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. 
With Sequelize, you don't need to write SQL anymore, it allows you create objects.
Read about it [here](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/).
**In this case for sequelize, MySQL must be downloaded and running in your computer.**

_I have used MySQL 5.7 which can downloaded from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/). Download mysql-installer-community-5.7.26.0.msi_

Used jQuery, for backend.

### Nodejs must be installed

To install Sequelize, MySQL and Express you need to run:

```npm init``` for initialzing

```npm i express``` for installing express into folder

```npm i mysql2```  for installing mysql

```npm i sequelize``` for installing sequelize
